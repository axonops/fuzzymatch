# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-13)

**Core value:** A developer can compare two strings (or scan a collection) with a known-correct algorithm and trust the resulting similarity score is mathematically sound, deterministic across platforms, and stable across patch releases.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — remaining-character-gestalt

## Current Position

Phase: 5
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Roadmap-shaping decisions recorded at roadmap creation:

- Phase 1 lands ALL foundation infrastructure (CI matrix, golden files, property-test harness, benchstat, release pipeline, AlgoID dispatch, Normalise with Unicode NFC/NFD, Tokenise, errors) BEFORE any algorithm — 9 of 20 inventoried pitfalls are infrastructure-gated
- Smith-Waterman-Gotoh is isolated into its own phase (Phase 3) due to the documented Gotoh 1982 erratum requiring EMBOSS/biopython cross-validation
- Phonetic algorithms get their own phase (Phase 7) due to unique licence-discipline and primary-source-sourcing characteristics (NYSIIS Taft 1970 hard to obtain; Double Metaphone's ~200-branch rule table)
- Scorer placement: AFTER all 23 algorithms (Phase 8) — spec's default choice; bringing it forward would churn default-Scorer composition with every algorithm addition
- AlgoID dispatch table established in Phase 1 (per FOUND-02) so Monge-Elkan (Phase 6) can take an inner AlgoID parameter without waiting for the full Scorer
- Extract API isolated into its own phase (Phase 10) after Scan, layering atop both single algorithms and the Scorer

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 1 readiness: confirm self-hosted bench runner availability for benchstat regression detection (falls back to `ubuntu-latest` informationally if unavailable)
- Phase 1 readiness: confirm CLA-vs-DCO choice (recommendation: CLA Assistant, mirroring `axonops/mask`)
- Phase 7 readiness: NYSIIS primary source (Taft 1970, NY State Special Report No. 1) is hard to obtain — may need to cite Knuth or a secondary review article during planning
